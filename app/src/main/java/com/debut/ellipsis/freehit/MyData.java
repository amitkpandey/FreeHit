    ,"So that's it from us for this game. We hope you enjoyed our coverage. India wrapped things up in time and they would have been pleased that they avenged the loss of 2015. Sri Lanka go back to the drawing board for the umpteenth time in the last few years. They need to raise the bar to stay afloat in the series. We look forward to your company for the 2nd Test starting on August 3, 2017 at Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, Colombo. Action begins at 1000 local (0430 GMT). Until then, it's goodbye and take care!"
    ,"Man of the Match, Shikhar Dhawan says that he really enjoyed batting out in the middle. Reckons that he was positive throughout and was looking to score runs. Adds that the competition in the side helps him bring out the best and also keeps him on the toes to keep performing."
    ,"This is India's biggest win away from home, fourth highest overall and it reflects in how they play. They are not yet a strong Test side but they do their basics right and it works against teams which are not that strong. They made a lot of mistakes, dropped catches, had poor bowling plans yet came out on top thanks to the gulf in the quality of the teams. They will want to build on this win and go forward."
    ,"No Rangana Herath, no Asela Gunaratne to bat and Sri Lanka have lost this Test inside four days. Doesn't it reflect perfectly on the two individuals? Those two have done most of the hard work in the last few series' and without them, it has been very hard for the home side. It has resulted in India winning for the first time in Galle since 2008."
    ,"o that's it from us for this game. Hope you enjoyed our coverage today. India have successfully clinched the ODI series and they will now play the World Champions for a single T20I at the same venue. West Indies will look to brush this defeat aside and look to capitalise on the shortest format of the game which begins on 9th July at 1030 local (1530 GMT). Until then, cheers and goodbye!"
    ,"Man of the Series, Ajinkya Rahane says that he wanted to make it count in the middle. Mentions that he was playing well in the nets in the Champion's Trophy as well. Informs that today's wicket was better to bat on than the previous two venues with Antigua being slightly damp and slow."
    ,"Indian captain and Man of the Match, Virat Kohli starts by saying that their aim was to win the series and he is delighted to make that happen. Appreciates Ajinkya Rahane and Kuldeep Yadav for their brilliant performances throughout the series. Reckons that he never looks at the stats and he always looks to give his best on the field. Informs that he likes to play in the tempo of the game and also looks to set the tempo at times. "
    ," Appreciates Dinesh Karthik for his fine knock today. Mentions that all the guys are exceptional as they have reached this level after quite some hard work. Adds that captaincy does not burden him much as he still plays the game in a similar manner as he used to when he was not a captain."
    ,"India have cruised towards yet another victory and have successfully clinched the 5-match ODI series 3-1. After being asked to bowl, the visitors displayed superb skills to restrict the hosts to a below par total."
